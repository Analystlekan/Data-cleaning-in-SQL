# SQL Data Cleaning Project: Layoffs Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset (`layoffs') containing information about layoffs across various companies, industries, countries, and dates using SQL queries. The primary goal is to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability for further analysis and reporting.

## Contents

1. **Data**: Contains the raw dataset (`layoffs') used for analysis.
2. **SQL Queries**: Includes SQL scripts (`data_cleaning.sql`) for data cleaning.
3. **Documentation**: This README.md file provides an overview of the data cleaning process.

## Data Cleaning Steps

### Step 1: Importing the Dataset

- **Dataset**: Imported `layoffs` into the SQL database.
  
### Step 2: Initial Assessment and Cleaning

- **Handling Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate entries from the dataset.
- **Managing Missing Values**: Handled missing values in critical fields (e.g., total_laid_off, date).
  
### Step 3: Standardizing Data Formats

- **Date Standardization**: Ensured consistent date formats across the dataset.
- **Data Consistency**: Checked and corrected inconsistencies in company names and other categorical data.

### Step 4: Correcting Anomalies

- **Data Anomalies**: Addressed any anomalies or outliers in the dataset.
- **Verification**: Verified data integrity and correctness after cleaning operations.

## Next Steps

The cleaned dataset  is now ready for further analysis to derive insights into layoffs trends by industry, company, country, and time.
